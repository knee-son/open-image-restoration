# State-of-the-art Open-source Image Restoration - SOIR

This project packages various deep-learning-based, state-of-the-art, and open source (MIT or Apache licenses) image restoration techniques.

The algorithms currently included in the packages are:

## Denoising
NLRN - Liu et al. 2018. Non-Local Recurrent Network for Image Restoration (NeurIPS 2018) - MIT License
https://github.com/Ding-Liu/NLRN

## Colorization
DeOldify ("NoGAN" algorithm) - Jason Antic, 2019 - MIT License
https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify

## Super-resolution
ESRGAN - Wang et al. 2018. ESRGAN: Enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ECCV 2018) - Apache-2.0 license
https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN


The project is a work in progress. However, it is already functional and can be tested through this [demo in google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TIksWoyd4L_qR73VoSF6igbKa8AnyKjG).
