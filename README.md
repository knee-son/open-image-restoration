# An Open-source framework for image restoration
This project packages various deep-learning-based, state-of-the-art, and open source (MIT or Apache licenses) image restoration techniques.

## Demo
The project is a work in progress. However, it is already functional and can be tested through this [demo in google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TIksWoyd4L_qR73VoSF6igbKa8AnyKjG).

## Technical details
The algorithms currently included in the packages are:
